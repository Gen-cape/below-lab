Welcome to my GitHub repository ðŸ’»

I am a programming enthusiast with a passion for mobile development ðŸ“± and data science ðŸ“Š. While I may not have a wealth of professional experience at the moment, I am constantly seeking out opportunities to improve my skills and broaden my knowledge in these fields.

One of my goals is to contribute to open source projects, as it allows me to not only gain valuable experience but also give back to the community. As Takemoto from Vagabond said, "I don't care about becoming famous or making a name for myself. I just want to keep walking my own path, one step at a time."

I hope that you find my repository enjoyable and informative. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you for visiting.
